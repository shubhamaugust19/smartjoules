    - Notes:
        - This API verifies that the `uuid` passed in the request parameter has been generated by the application itself. If it doesn't exist, it will respond with a `403`  status code with the following response:
        
        ```jsx
        {
        	message: "UUID is not recognised."
        }
        ```
        
        - In case the API is not rate limited
            - Generate a random number between 1000 and 2000 and send it in the `balance` key
            - it will send the following response with a `200` status code:
        
        ```jsx
        {
        	message: "API check was succesfull!",
        	balance: 1569 //Randomly generated number
        }
        ```
        
        - In case the API is rate limited, it will send the following response with a `429` status code:
        
        ```jsx
        {
        	message: "API has exceeded more than 10 times in the last minute."
        }
        ```
